Project Name: Trello API + Orange HRM
.
Project Idea: This project focuses on testing two different platforms: Trello, a task management and
collaboration tool, and OrangeHRM, a human resource management system. Using Selenium
WebDriver, the project covers essential user journeys such as login, task/board management in
Trello, and employee record management in OrangeHRM. The goal is to design reliable automated
test cases, apply best practices and deliver a maintainable test suite with clear reporting of pass/fail
outcomes.
